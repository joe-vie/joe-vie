## Hey y'all's! My name is Jovie! ꉂ(˵˃ ᗜ ˂˵)⸜

I am a 17-year-old senior from NYC! °❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･

I partake in many acting-related activities. I go to an arts high school where I've participated in school productions & been part of original student productions. I also act on film outside of school and look to do it professionally! °❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･

Apart from my love for acting, tech has been one of my biggest passions. I've participated in programs through Kode With Klossy and Girls Who Code, where I learned the basics of web development, app development, cybersecurity, and data science. My love for learning more about tech inspired me to join Hack Club, where I was part of the organizing team for Luna, Counterspell NYC, and Daydream NYC, primarily focusing on content creation through social media, leading workshops, and outreach. °❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･

Overall, I would like to continue making an impact at Hack Club, fight for Latina representation in tech, and pursue both of my passions! °❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･

Signing off! See you all in a while, my crocodiles 🐊! °❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･
